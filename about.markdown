Hi! I'm a Software Engineer from Los Angeles, CA. I've been  developing for the web since 2002.

I'm the co-founder of Tattio, a service for tattoo shops and tattoo enthusiasts.

I've given a few talks at code meetups in the Los Angeles and Long Beach area and I am always 
working on something interesting.

In my spare time I enjoy playing board games, gaming on my PC with friends or making music with my
digital audio workstation.
