On April 19th I accepted an offer from Edmunds.com, Inc. in Santa Monica California.

I received notification about an open position through one of my LinkedIn contacts which I happened to have met at the
Southern California Linux Expo a few years back.

I had just completed an Engineering Immersion program that helped get a solid grasp on Computer Science fundamentals
that provided me with enough confidence to pass a full 5-hour interview.

I don’t know much about Cars. I can change my oil, change a flat tire and check my tire pressure but that’s about it.

I was hired to work on a team that specializes in creating “Tier 3 products” for automotive dealerships. The group I’ll
be working on is the CarCode team which creates a product that helps dealers increase their sales. I am pretty excited!

One of the best things I’ve heard so far about working at Edmunds is their fantastic company culture.

I’ve never worked anywhere like this before. I keep pinching myself to make sure I’m awake.

I mean take a look at this:

It’s a dream come true, and I can’t wait to see how this new journey plays out!
